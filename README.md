# Jupyter Notebook: Explaining Credit Fraud Predictions with SHAP and ChatGPT
This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide to using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret predictions made by a Random Forest model for credit fraud categorisation. 
Additionally, it leverages ChatGPT to provide natural language explanations for the model's predictions.

Setup Instructions:
### Install Required Packages:
